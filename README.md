CIA Cover Story

## Project Description

Finally! You don't have to invest time in creating your own cover story when you're engage in espionage.  The handy dandy CIA Cover Story application will take the guess work out of your fake future! 

This is a fun web page I built from scratch (my first ever actually). It leverages HTML, CSS5 and Javascript to make RESTFUL API calls to two endpoints. I have thought about converting this to a React app for practice; though I am not sure I want to do so.  I do want to change up the style to make it look more like the CIA website as well as fix the CORS issue so that any user can successfully make an API call and use the app.
